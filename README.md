The result of Relation Mapping process, looks like as I am helping Bruce Joy make sense of the system
underpinning 1Unit, a survey and task management system used by hospitals in Australia, US and Canada.
In the video, we are dissecting the backend to provide more context into how to refactor the application
and to provide a more general understanding of concepts and design. Through this, a founder will have
better understanding of the platform design from a db/dataflow perspective. The video captures the entire
mapping session where I spent 3 hrs asking questions to Bruce (founder and domain expert) in order to
extract the necessary structure for better communication with his tech team:
